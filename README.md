# polarml
A repository to help familiarize myself with rust, polars and ML libraries

## Why?
This repository is inspired by @noahgift. Finding his page inspired my to try and use rust for machine learning. While there was a bit of a learning curve,
it definitely taught me some new concepts in programming. And it was honestly fun to program in and fgure these things out. I feel like I have a much 
better grasp on the language now, as well as some other libraries. Next steps will be to try other machine learning models, as well as using polars more, 
in order to clean the data, which was not done here.

### Notes
Need function to check if the model directory exists, if not create one. Store that in a new file that handles are directory and file operations (call it like file.rs or something)

Implement a function to incorporate linfa and compare it to smartcore. This means that linfa and smartcore can be stored in a submodule in src or something
