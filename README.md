# polarml
A repository to help familiarize myself with rust, polars and ML libraries

## Why?
This repository is inspired by @noahgift. Finding his page inspired my to try and use rust for machine learning. While there was a bit of a learning curve,
it definitely taught me some new concepts in programming. And it was honestly fun to program in and fgure these things out. I feel like I have a much 
better grasp on the language now, as well as some other libraries. Next steps will be to try other machine learning models, as well as using polars more, 
in order to clean the data, which was not done here.

### Notes

- [x] Need function to check for directory where models saved to
- [x] Create New file to handle any file operation functions
- [ ] Incorporate Linfa into the project to compare to smartcore
    - [ ] Look to create subdirectory in src/ to handle smartcore and linfa files
- [ ] move the model directory to project root folder 
- [ ] create function for reading in the saved models (DRY code)
